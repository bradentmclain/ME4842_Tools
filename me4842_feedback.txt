Response 1
A bit more guidance or initial feedback would be helpful for the project ideas.
================================================================================
Response 2
The main thing that was sometimes frustrating about this class was the timeframe. It felt like, frequently, we were given an assignment which required feedback from a previous assignment. But, we didn't get the feedback until halfway through the the time we had for the next assignment. This made it stressful to complete some assignments to our desired standards in the time available to us.
================================================================================
Response 3
1.) Yes I enjoyed having the ability to choose experiments that I found interesting and felt would be beneficial to learn based on the field that I am going into.
2.) Keep the initial concept generation, having the option to talk to the TAs one on one for feedback with this was a tremendous help. Keep the initial concept revision as it gives students the ability to either refine their experiment or pivot based on the direction they are going and gain valuable feedback along the way.
3.) Have time for questions during lectures during the semester regarding the final experiment. other than that every things was stated.
4.) No suggestions at this time, thank you!

1) I was a big fan of being able to choose the labs we wanted to do. 
2) Yes, I think the initial concept generation is helpful!
3) I feel like the examples provided give a good idea of what to expect
4) None
================================================================================
Response 6
1.) I liked being able to choose the labs, but I feel like having some different options of labs would be cool as well.
2.) The initial concept generation and revision were good. I feel like there should've been more discussion of the project and what was expected in class. I feel like I got most of the info on it from the class manual, and being able to discuss the semester long process in class would've been nice to hear. But I'm also more of an auditory learner, so reading it doesn't retain as well as hearing it for me.
3.) I feel like going over a few past projects would be extremely helpful. I didn't quite understand the full scope of what my project was supposed to be (like steps to take and assignments/papers I needed to do) until around halfway through the semester. Just walk people through the semester with an example project really quick in class one day.
4.) I liked the class, but I think there needed to be more in-class explanation of class/project expectations rather than just referring to the manual all the time.
================================================================================
Response 7
1) Yes
2) Keep both
3) I think the current explanations are adequate
4) If possible, pushing the schedule forward to ensure parts arrive before the semester's week long break would help allow for teams to make progress on the final experiment much earlier.
================================================================================
Response 8
Being able to pick the labs made them much more enjoyable as I was able to pick the ones I found interesting. The initial concept generation revision is a must have, more feedback would be good though to avoid last minute changes in projects as happened with my team after our proposal.
================================================================================
Response 9
I did appreciate the choice of labs at the beginning of the semester. More communication towards the end of the semester about deadlines and how the poster symposium runs would be helpful.
================================================================================
Response 10
I enjoyed this class and the ability to choose my labs
================================================================================
Response 11
The poster symposium could be improved with poster stands, and more faculty invited. As it is, it was quite straightforward and if the current method is kept I believe that groups should be able to just sign up for a time slot within their lab time to present their poster.

Additionally, I think that more timely feedback for memo 1 may be useful just because it was a bit late to have helped us on writing our lab memo 2.

For the lecture portion, I would like to see guest lecturers brought in. As it stands, BSME has essentially 2 capstone courses in 4761 Senior Design and 4842 Systems. Senior Design is more of a capstone in what industry work as an ME looks like and Systems is a capstone in research and experimental design. I'd like to see research focused guest speakers throughout the semester that lean into that aspect of the course, interspersed with relevant discussions by Prof. Stutts like we had about every 3rd week thus semester.

The textbook is great and I love how in depth it is, however I have heard students that don't have a PDF reader expressing concerns with how hard it is to find specific things: usually most topics or questions you may have have 2 or 3 places you might look in the book. Some sort of consolidation or reorganization would be fantastic!
================================================================================
Response 12
I enjoyed being able to, somewhat, choose which two of the three standard labs we could do. I think the idea for concept generation and revision is fine but i wish we could have gotten our parts before thanksgiving break so we could have built the experiment before rather than rushing when we got back. I wish the purchase request form was maybe a week earlier to help us get a better start on our experiment and not feel as rushed.
================================================================================
Response 13
A little bit more of an advanced notice about when exactly the final experiment poster symposium is would be helpful. It snuck up on me and I didn't see the notice about when it was until 5 days before.
================================================================================
Response 14
The only suggestion i would have is to provide a little more information about the symposium at the end of the semester. I don't want to say that we were rushed at the end of the semester but we were unsure of how the symposium  was meant to run so it caused some minor stress.

1) enjoyed getting to choose labs. Made it more enjoyable if we actually wanted to do it. 
2) yes I think these were helpful. 
3) maybe include details about this being a project that is looked at to be replicated in the lab and is easily repeatable and understandable by students taking class. Knowing this would help choose a better experiment to study for this task.
================================================================================
Response 17
I think the overall timeline for the semester was just a little bit off, there were some gaps in the middle of the semester where there was almost nothing for us to do for a week and then at the end it was a bit of a crunch to get the project done on time before the poster presentation, but maybe that is just because we had our experiment figured out and if we had needed to do more work on developing the experiment it would have been nicer to have that time at the start. Overall I think it is structured pretty well, it was a 2 credit hour class that felt like 2 credit hours which I appreciated.

I appreciated getting to choose between the labs but did not find the additional lectures to be helpful after the first few weeks of class.
================================================================================
Response 20
Memo 1 felt like so much work to get done by yourself. I get that it is because you want each person to be able to fully write a memo without any help but I think that it should either have more time to complete it or it should be another group completed memo.
================================================================================
Response 21
It would be nice if the ordering process started sooner. We almost didn't get our project done in time because most of our stuff did not come until during or after Thanksgiving break, and our presentation was the Monday after we came back from break. I felt we were able to submit our order form sooner than we actually did, but the due date was so late for the order form.
================================================================================
Response 22
I enjoyed being able to choose the labs I was more interested in. Also, Braden was my TA and did an excellent job.
================================================================================
Response 23
1. Yes I did appreciate choosing.
2. Yes I liked having to come up with multiple ideas.
3. Possibly in one of those lectures where you just have to fill time maybe walk through a great previous project from start to finish what they provided during each of those intermediate steps what they report looks like what their data looks like.
4. Overall to improve the class I would say push up the timeline a little bit to receive materials a little sooner. I felt like it was a rush at the very end for a whole bunch of teams waiting on materials.
================================================================================
Response 24
Being able to choose the standard labs was nice. The concept generation worked very well in the semester. To improved the class it needs to flow more steadily, for everyone I talked to, the class was hell for the first 4 weeks or so then it felt stagnant the next 6 weeks, Then the last two weeks were hell again. It felt like we created a concept then were ignored for a while then we put in orders for materials and a week before dead week we got our materials, and had to finish everything within 7 days, it felt ridiculous.
================================================================================
Response 25
To be completely honest, the labs were fine, however I feel like their biggest take away was practicing writing engineering reports. I think the next semester could benefit more by starting earlier on the projects, and if the lectures were based more about what is expected from the projects or were used as work time for the projects like Senior Design does. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed learning from Dr. Stutts and Braden!
================================================================================
Response 26
As much as the labs were nice. Maybe only doing 2 labs to give more time to work on our project and receive feedback so the proposal presentation can be a lot more detailed. Also the deadline between building and presenting the project is very tight so more time allotted for that would help a lot.
================================================================================
Response 27
Being able to chose which experiments we did was great as it allow us to do more of what we were interested in doing. As for the initial concept generation, I would have liked to have seen Dr. Stutts more involved in the process of picking a project rather than only during the concept presentation, after a lot of work was already done and potentially getting your project changed. As for the lectures themselves, I didn't think I gained any useful knowledge from them, whether that be for the project or for use outside of the class. They just didn't seem beneficial in any way, other than the LaTeX and presentation requirements lectures.
================================================================================
Response 28
Actually teach something in class that can apply to the labs and projects.
================================================================================
Response 29
I think the course is set up well, the flow makes sense, none of the assignments are overly challenging, and the labs were interesting. The biggest letdown for my group and I this semester was our TA, Amen Eze. She was not helpful, did not provide useful feedback, did not provide any feedback in a timely manner,  delayed our project by pushing off deadlines, and was not there for any of the labs. We had Braden as a replacement for most of these tasks, which sucked for him because he was getting swamped with work, but he still provided a much higher quality experience, consistently answered questions, and provided useful feedback.
================================================================================
Response 30
I do not have any feedback, I though the class was very good as a whole.
================================================================================
Response 31
I really enjoyed the standard labs and the fact that our team was able to select those that we wanted to do. I believe these are the best lab experiments I have participated in here at MST. However, much of the report writing seems over the top, and I felt like this class was largely aimed at students wishing to pursue Graduate research, something I have no interest in. I am not sure how to remedy this; I think a different selection of final project may have been in my best interest in retrospect (this is my fault not the course). Overall, I still believe this course could be altered somehow to steer away from feeling like a graduate school prep.
================================================================================
Response 32
Thank you for all your help Braden! Good luck in your future endeavors.

Response 33
The only feedback I have is that the resources available to students should be more well-known. As the four-bar linkage was very accessible and free.
================================================================================
Response 34
I liked choosing the experiments but the first one was much harder than the rest. Learning new software and new material with such a short turn around felt a bit rushed. The project wasn't hard, but learning latex and getting the report completed, with the code, in such a short time was difficult.  I think starting the project earlier would have been helpful. Defining the project and ordering parts sooner would have allowed greater time for debugging and expanding on project objectives. Overall, just felt a bit rushed. Good support from faculty and staff.
================================================================================
Response 35
I really enjoyed the class and the way it was able to bring together so many fundamental concepts. The initial concept generation was very helpful and the revision was also a good stepping stone that allowed for the class to have a more simple easy to follow structure that promotes engagement and a better final product. I think the class could be improved by more thorough or critical feedback towards proposals or presentations. Perhaps the feedback should not come in the form of harsh grades necessarily, at least for concept generation, revision, or proposals as they are great opportunities for growth, but in terms of comments and suggestions for improvement. I also believe time for feedback during the presentations was limited and could be benefited by a longer presentation period or two stages of proposal presentations with one being earlier in the semester to set students on the right track for success. It was also not explicitly clear that the $100 dollar budget was flexible, and by explicitly allowing or even encouraging promising teams to put in individual requests for budget exceptions would allow for some better quality results as different experiments may require different levels of complexity and therefore cost.
================================================================================
Response 36
1. I did like that, I just thought the pump lab with the pumps broken was kind of goofy
2. Yes, I would keep them both. I think the class could just really benefit from a better description and presentation of the project.
3. I would recommend a lecture just describing what you mean by systems, what the project should contain, and what would be something cool to present. Get other faculty involved.
4. Set lecture schedule, and I think such a huge focus on technical writing is kind of silly. I would like it to be more about different systems and types of systems, like my favorite lecture was on piezoelectricity.
================================================================================
Response 37
1) I appreciated being able to choose labs 2) keep concept generation, it was very helpful 3) Maybe using lecture time to show more examples of final experiments would be useful? Maybe also using that time to make students aware of the resources the mech e department has to check out equipment/run experiments etc would help a lot? There were a lot of tools available to our group that I didn't realize existed if not for my groupmates. 4) Generally my two biggest suggestions are using lecture time more efficiently (as in feedback 3)) and improving communication for project deadlines/moving the timeline of the project up. Though it worked out in the end for our group, I really wish we were able to have our budget approved sooner and had more time after we obtained all of our parts from Amazon, Lowes, etc to do our experiment because it ended up being more rushed than we would've liked (had like a day or two between the announcement of when the poster symposiums were and having to submit our final poster to the poster shop, and the parts that we ordered had just come in about 3 days prior). 5) That being said I do want to give Braden a shout out for being a great TA because it really felt like he had to take on more work for the class than he should've. He responded to our questions/emails super quickly, offered a lot of help with experiments/memo feedback (speaking of that memo regrades were super nice and were a great opportunity to not only improve class grades but also improve memo writing skills) and overall had good communication about the class, especially earlier in the semester. Overall did a great job 🫡
================================================================================
Response 38
I liked choosing the labs. The list of allowed experiments was unclear to me. I wasn't sure if all experiments involving pipe flow are not allowed, or if there had to be sufficient complexity. A rubric or some objective way to rate/grade ideas would be good.
Scheduling felt very haphazard in this class.
================================================================================
Response 39
The class is set up well, I think there maybe needs to be a team selection process similar to that of Senior Design (answering questionnaires then being paired up after). I understand that lab sections are relatively small but I got two terrible people lol and our group had low synergy.

Being able to choose two out of the three lab experiments was nice, but I feel as if it's hard to get a good idea of what each lab is about unless you read every word about them in the manual. I think the initial concept generation and revision is nice, but I think the TAs and Dr. Stutts need to be in better touch because our TA approved of our initial experiment idea but Dr. Stutts hated it and we had to restart.

I think the work load and timeline for this class needs to be adjusted. As a two credit hour class, I spent more time on assignments for class than any of my others. I understand the goal of this class and the methods to achieve that goal but the size of reports and the project timeline is overly aggressive. I do think this class offers many valuable lessons that many students need to learn.

Yes, choosing two out of the three labs was very much appreciated. I think that the initial concept generation and revision assignments were much appreciated. Overall, I think it was a good class to test our gained knowledge and allow us to run an experiment for ourselves.

Response 48
To be completely honest I was not a fan of the structuring of this course. The schedule did not seem firm and well thought out. By this I mean that the spacing of assignments could have been much better. I think that we should instead have two labs, one individual and one group lab. I believe these labs should begin sooner in the semester to give students more time to complete the memos, and more emphasis should be put on how long the memos will take to complete. As for the final experiment, my group barely had enough time to put our experiment together and complete it, resulting in data that we were not as proud of as we would have liked to be.  Parts for the final experiment need to be ordered sooner, and the proposals need to be sooner in the semester. Our group had our proposal approved quickly, however not all groups were lucky enough to have the same situation. There needs to be better scheduling for the final experiment overall in my opinion, especially when a majority of students are also in senior design. The TAs took longer than expected to grade assignments as well.
================================================================================
Response 49
I did like that we got to choose two out of the three standard labs we conducted, it felt like we were all specializing into something we wanted to do, and that was an interesting topic to us, initial concept generation and revision was good, as well as the first memo revision was a great way to give feedback to the students without penalizing them fully. Personally, just felt like my group ran out of time for the final experiment, and that maybe an extra week would have been nice, but not sure where that extra week could have been gotten from.
================================================================================
Response 50
I feel like this is just identical to Instrumentation. It felt a little redundant and was also really difficult to manage alongside Senior Design, so it wasn't the most enjoyable. Also, lectures were completely useless unless you were legitimately interested in the topics. Just a vibrations class with Dr. stutts or something as an elective would be better.
================================================================================
Response 51
1) I think that being able to choose the standard labs to complete was a good way to learn about topics that interest students, especially because there is not a lot of new information taught in this course. 
2)I think that the main difficulty we faced as a group was very late or lack of feedback from out TA. while the concept generation and revision system seems like a good idea, and does function well in courses like Senior Design. for this group there was so little feedback on the initial generation that we had to go straight to the professor to get an experiment, despite completing both those assignments. in fact one of the only comments we received on our concept generation assignment was to ask the professor for feedback.
3) it is hard to see what the aimed takeaway from this course is.  I think combining this course with Instrumentation or Senior Design would allow for a more in-depth and well thought out project or experiment over two semesters which I feel student would get more out of.
================================================================================
Response 52
I liked having the option of choosing the lab activities and final report. The only complaint I have is our TA not grading work on time and pushing back our assignments, such as not grading memo 1 in time so then we don't know what needs to be altered or changed for memos 2 and 3.
================================================================================
Response 53
Overall, I liked the way the lab was setup and the standard labs being early in the semester. I would suggest that with some groups needing to present their final experiment so early, it would have been nice to get a heads up on the poster symposium and gotten our materials ordered a bit earlier. Other than that, Brendan was a great TA and deserves a lot of credit for our teams success.
================================================================================

The gap between Thanksgiving break and us presenting the posters was very awkward. We got our materials 2 days before our poster was due, and we had a lot of issues renting equipment such as the NI DAQ's.

I liked having the choice between labs. the concept generation process was good as is. The only improvement would be to finalize the final projects sooner because there were periods where I felt like I wasn't doing anything for this class (because we were in a lull) and then the end of the semester felt rushed.
================================================================================
Response 58
Try to move materials ordering sooner and provide earlier reminders about the poster symposium, it was very tight schedule wise to run the experiment and make the poster and this led to not having enough time to do multiple runs to collect more data.

================================================================================
Response 60
I liked being able to choose 2 out of the 3 standard labs that were conducted. I do think it would have been helpful to have a little deeper description of each before we decided which labs we wanted to do. I'm fine with changing the initial concept proposed for the final project, I think feedback is important and good. I Dr. Stutts said that students in the past wanted the lab manual to be in one place, but I think it would be helpful if it was broken up into sections and honestly more detailed to what students are actually doing. I feel like the manual takes a very broad approach. I think the class needs more structure in general. It might be beneficial if there were maybe 20 math models that students could choose to verify. That way the professor and TA's would be more knowledgeable in the subject area and be able to help with questions. I feel like this class was just an independent study. It also would've been nice if the lectures related directly to the course.
================================================================================
Response 61
1. I liked having a choice between initial labs. 
2. I also liked being able to choose our own experiment and getting a chance to revise and make it better.
3. I think making it more apparent that the experiment should be of similar quality to the in-lab experiments would be beneficial.
4. The class seemed to go dormant during the middle of the semester. In my opinion, moving up the final experiment approval and material ordering would cause less stress at the end of the semester and allow for more time to work on the experiment and improve it.
================================================================================

Better time management during the proposal presentation and poster symposium. I know that during both of ours we were there past the allotted time. This was frustrating see as how most of us had things scheduled soon after the presentations.

The ability to choose what lab you get to do is very nice since that allows your group to pick something that is more interesting.

I think my judgment on this is distorted by the experience with our TA. I think most of our issues came from a lack of feedback, but I don't know details of anything going on behind the scenes that would have caused that.
